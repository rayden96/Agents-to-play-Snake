1. Set up the solver such that it is ready to run with all neceserry text outputs. Dont make it display more than necessary. - done

2. Implement the base statistical analysis of the results. - done

3. play with the parameters, consider adding more options for the GP and better genetic operators.

4. Run the results. 

5. write the paper.


Final Updates:

PSO - running optimally - potentially increase population size and initial generation range and maybe more exploration or exploitation?
